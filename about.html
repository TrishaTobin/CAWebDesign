          <h2>What our Guests say about us........</h2>
          <p><em>I stayed at Seahaven last St Patrick's weekend with my Partner. We had a wonderful time. Tom was so friendly and helpful. He is extremely knowlegable on the area and helped us get the most our of our short stay. As well as getting the sea air we spent time in Dublin city. We visited Trinity College and soaked up the St Patrick's Day atmosphere.</em><br /><b>Jim, Long Island, New York. March 2018.</b> </p>
          <p><em>I stayed at Seahaven with my husband and our 2 children last week. We travelled from Wales to attend a family wedding in Malahide Castle. We were blown away by the 5 star accommodation and treatment offered to us. Tom and his family were so helpful and organised our transport to and from the Church. Although it was a short distance away it would have been difficult to walk with 2 small children. Breakfast was superb and as Vegetarian it was amazing to be offered a hot healthy vegetarian breakfast. My two little boys also thoroughly enjoyed their homecooked breakfast and to my surprise cleared their plates. The morning after the wedding we all enjoyed a walk on the beach.My husband is a keen Angler and Tom organised a sea fishing trip which was suitable for all the family to enjoy.</em><br /><b>Lulu, Llanelli, Wales. April 2018.</b>/P>
          <p><em>I travel to Malahide on a regular basis with a group of my friends from Kerry to play golf in Malahide Golf Club. We have always previously stayed in local hotels but after spending a weekend in Seahaven we will be returing. The standard of the accommodation is unique, the bed linen is of the utmost quality and the walk-in rain showers are a perfect wind down following a day on the golf course and in preparation for the evening ahead - fabulous meal, followed by friendly pub athmosphere and all within walking distance from Seahaven</em><br /> <b>Paudi, Dingle, Co. Kerry. May 2018.</b></p>
